# Cancer-detection-
This project aims to detect cancer in patients and to improve the process of cancer detection using AI (aims: AI in Healthcare))
1.	Project Objective: To detect whether a patient is suffering from cancer or not
Many of the times cancer remains undetected specially at earlier stages as a result the treatment is delayed. Many of the times patient has to suffer from seviour surgeries. In case of Benign tumors it can spread to other body parts too. 
This project aims to detect cancer using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts 
2.	Scope & Requirements
 	Functional Requirements
•	This project uses input from sensor and detect the presence of cancer.
•	Rationalize the decision of Agent to get better results with least possible error
•	Sensor = data (radius, texture, smoothness, mutation etc.)
•	Agent = decision-making algorithm (linear model, search techniques, probability model etc.)
 	2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
•	Data Representation to say the probability of having cancer or not
•	Using different search algorithms for cancer detection and analyzing which will suit the best 
•	Using probability to know what is the probability of patient to suffer from cancer.
•	Using Local maxima and local minima to say about the size of tumor
•	There can be errors in detection the data can be because of overfitting and underfitting
•	Using Bias and Variances in case of any error to correct it and make result more accurate
•	Applying the concept of supervised learning to label the data and detect local maxima and local minima easily.     It will help to detect the size to tumor in comparatively less time and the results can be shown earlier.
